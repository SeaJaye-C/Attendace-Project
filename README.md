# Attendace Project
 This python project uses facial recogniton to mark attendace in a database
 Through making this project ive become aware of a few issues. 
installing dlib often is a very buggy process depending on operating system. If needed please remove dlib line from requirements.txt then install.

install respective requirments by either typing

pip install -r requirements.txt

or

pip install -r requirements_windows.txt

into the terminal directed to the respected folder of this project
It is reccomeded to use 3.11.5 or below at the time of this project due to bugs with python 3.12

The code will use your first/inital webcam of your pc. Thanks for checking my project out
